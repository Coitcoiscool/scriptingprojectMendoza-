    // Start is called before the first frame update
     Mathf.Lerp function takes 3 float parameters: one representing the value to interpolate from; another representing the value to interpolate to and a final float representing how far to interpolate.
      Linearly interpolating is finding a value that is some percentage between two given values.
    float result = Mathf.Lerp (3f,5f,0.5f);
     The result of these functions is finding a colour that is some blend of two given colours and a vector that is some percentage of the way between the two given vectors
    Vector3 from from = new Vector3
     Vector3 result = new Vector3 (5f,6f,7f);S
      Vector3 result = Vector3.Lerp (from, to,0.75);

    // Update is called once per frame
    change to intensity would happen per second instead of per frame.
    void Update()
